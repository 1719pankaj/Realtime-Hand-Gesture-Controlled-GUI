## Realtime-Hand-Gesture-Controlled-GUI
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This project is an interesting conglomeration of ML, Tensorflow, opencv and a few other python libraries which lets you control your mouse and various other graphical inputs(like inreasing/decreasing volume, changing screen brightness, seeking to a particular point in a video etc), just by using your hands.

-It recognises what gesture you are trying to make, and carries out specific functions according to that gesture.

-For example, the most interesting of the lot is controlling the mouse, clicking and dragging around stuffs around the screen using your index finger(for moving the pointer) and thumb(for clicking and dragging).

-Other gestures include the use of index and middle finger to raise or lower systemwide master volume.

-And there are many more to come.

Come join me and help me out to further enhance this project.
